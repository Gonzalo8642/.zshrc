## My zsh config file
Contains my personal zsh config

## Install
Install [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

`git clone https://github.com/Gonzalo8642/zshrc` 
Or download the repo

Copy my `.zshrc` file to your home directory
On command line:
```
zshrc         #No need to type in "cd zshrc" if you're using zsh instead of bash
mv .zshrc ~/  #Move .zshrc to your home dir
..            #No need to type "cd .." if you're using zsh instead of bash
rm zshrc      #Clean up 
```

## Install syntax highlighting

```
brew install zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

If you do not have or do not like homebrew, follow [the installation instructions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/INSTALL.md) instead.
